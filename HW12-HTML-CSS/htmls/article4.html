            <h1 id="section1">What is Python?</h1>
            <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its ease of use and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.</p>
            <p>What sets Python apart is not just its readability and ease of use but also its robust standard library that makes it an ideal choice for a wide array of applications, from web development to data analysis, artificial intelligence, and beyond.</p>
            <p>As we embark on this journey, we will explore the core principles that make Python a language of choice for beginners and professionals alike. We will delve into its syntax, which is often praised for being as readable as English, and its dynamic nature that allows for quick development and easy debugging.</p>
            <p>Join us as we uncover the reasons why Python has become the go-to language for millions, and how it continues to evolve to meet the ever-changing demands of the tech industry.</p>

            <h1 id="section2">Get Started with Python</h1>
